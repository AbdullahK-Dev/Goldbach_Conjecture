I am attempting to make an algorithm that tests Goldbach's Conjecture(every even number > 2 can be written as the sum of 2 prime numbers, for example "8 = 5 + 3").

The goal of this project is to help me improve core skills of programing, specifically readability and effencincy when writing code.
Also its a fun puzzle :D

To improve effeciency I have implemeneted:
  Sieve of Erathonos algorithm - this helps with large ranges of prime numbers.
  Use of arrays from Numpy library - Arrays are faster then lists and I am only using Integers so it is the most logical choice.

To improve Redability I have implemented:
  Subroutines - to reduce the amount of nesting required and assist in maintainablilty.
  Descriptive variable names - although they may be abit lengthy at times I believe it is better to prioritse making them understable because this algorithm can get complicated.
  Comments where neccesary.

I may not get to completing all of these further steps however here is a rough outline of places i could improve/expand on in this project.
Further steps:
  Port the code to C++ to reduce run time.
  Explore more prime number generating algorithms such as Sieve of Atkin and Sieve of Sundaram.
  Implement graphs using libraries such as seaborn to: compare effecincy of different prime number generator algorithms ;explore patterns between prime numbers such as the differences between them.
